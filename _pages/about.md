I am a third year Ph.D. student studying Materials Science Engineering and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan. <br />

My research focuses on data-driven materials discovery though the use of machine learning, natural language processing, and bayesian statistics. <br />

In particular, Iâ€™m interested in developing new predictive synthesis models that not only gauge the `synthesizability' of a material, but also yield the recipes to do so.  <br />

I received my B.S. in Materials Science Engineering, with an additional major in Applied Physics, from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA.
