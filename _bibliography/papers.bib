abstract  ="Synthesis of predicted materials is the key and final step needed to realize a vision of computationally accelerated materials discovery. Because so many materials have been previously synthesized{,} one would anticipate that text-mining synthesis recipes from the literature would yield a valuable dataset to train machine-learning models that can predict synthesis recipes for new materials. Between 2016 and 2019{,} the corresponding author (Wenhao Sun) participated in efforts to text-mine 31 782 solid-state synthesis recipes and 35 675 solution-based synthesis recipes from the literature. Here{,} we characterize these datasets and show that they do not satisfy the “4 Vs” of data-science—that is: volume{,} variety{,} veracity and velocity. For this reason{,} we believe that machine-learned regression or classification models built from these datasets will have limited utility in guiding the predictive synthesis of novel materials. On the other hand{,} these large datasets provided an opportunity to identify anomalous synthesis recipes—which in fact did inspire new hypotheses on how materials form{,} which we later validated by experiment. Our case study here urges a re-evaluation on how to extract the most value from large historical materials-science datasets."}
